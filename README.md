# Contractlist
This was made for RoadtoWeb3 hackathon by EthGlobal.
Contractlist is a Tooling project which can be used to access information of latest smart contract addresses of various projects and protocols. As smart contract developers, there often arises a need to know about the address of some other contracts in order to make an integration with other DApps and Protocols. It demands that we lookup their documentation to find the list of deployed contracts. But this is usually time-consuming and sometimes frustrating in nature as this is a difficult path. First of all, there is a web app, whose UI is a fork of Chainlist. The web app can be used to lookup projects and view their contract addresses instantly. Secondly we provide a free API for developers to easily access and query addresses of specific contracts. And finally we provide a data feed, intended to enable other smart contracts to access data from Contractlist. The data feed smart contract acts as an intermediary between our own API and other smart contracts, which can request the address of another contract from our intermediary smart contract. For eg, a smart contract which has a Uniswap integration can use our data feed to obtain the latest contract addresses of Uniswap, without it having to be hardcoded or manually updated.
